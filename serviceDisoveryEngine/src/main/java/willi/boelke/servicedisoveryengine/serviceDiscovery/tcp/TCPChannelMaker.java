/**
 * TCP creates a virtual channel between to communication partners. Only during binding procedure,
 * there are two roles: server and client. Server opens a port to which clients can connect to.
 *
 * After connection, there are an open socket. That class implements that view.
 * Objects of that class can be retrieved by some static factory methods. Again:
 * getting e.g. a server channel makes no difference as soon as a connection is established.
 *
 * After object creation, start that channel thread simply by calling start().
 * Call @see isConnected() to check if a connection was created or @see waitUntilConnectionEstablished()
 * which blocks the calling thread until a connection was established.
 *
 * After connection establishment, methods by @see getInputStream() and @see getOutputStream()
 * can be used to get I/O streams to use the TCP channel.
 *
 * When creating a server, createSocket can be called more than once, if and only if,
 * a server was created with multiple-flag set true (@see getTCPServerCreator()).
 * In that case, the server accepts multiple client connection attempts and tries to create
 * a new connection with each call on createSocket.
